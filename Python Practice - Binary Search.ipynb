    "As the player, an optimal strategy for the general case is to start by choosing the range's midpoint as the guess, and then asking whether the guess was higher, lower, or equal to the secret number. If the guess was too high, one would select the point exactly between the range midpoint and the beginning of the range. If the original guess was too low, one would ask about the point exactly between the range midpoint and the end of the range. This process repeats until one has reached the secret number."
